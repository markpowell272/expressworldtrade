            For example, the AI company 'Five AI' is aiming to transform
            European cities for safer, driverless cars. The service is for
            people who are currently using cars for their daily commute. Company
            has already started trials in the UK, and aims to bring supervised
            trial cars to the major freeways by mid-2020. To take another
            example: 'Dandelion' is a startup, focusing on geothermal pump
            installations to harness energy from below the Earth's surface to
            keep homes hot and cold during different seasons. The geothermal
            installation will keep the homes cool in Summer by pumping heat away
            from home into the Earth's crust, and in Winter keeps it warm by
            pumping back heat from below the Earth into the house. <br /> <br />{" "}
